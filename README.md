# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m a **Computer Science graduate (Class of 2025)** with a deep passion for understanding how technology works from the ground up. I love exploring software systems in their entirety, from their *low-level building blocks* to *high-level architectural design*. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in building projects with the **MERN stack**, where I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications. Alongside this, I regularly sharpen my problem-solving skills through **Data Structures and Algorithms**, as I believe they form the backbone of writing efficient and reliable code.  

My curiosity doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”it drives me to dig deeper into core **Computer Science concepts**. Iâ€™m fascinated by **Operating Systems**, especially *concurrency* and *scheduling algorithms*, as they reveal the intricate details of how systems manage resources. I also enjoy working with **low-level programming in C**, which helps me connect *theory with the inner workings* of hardware and software. Another area I actively explore is **Computer Networks**, with a special focus on *routing algorithms* and how information flows across distributed systems.  

Beyond just coding, Iâ€™m equally interested in the *bigger picture*: how systems **scale securely**, **maintain reliability**, and **operate efficiently** in the real world. My goal is to bring together *hands-on development experience* with **robust architectural insights**, blending the mindset of a *problem-solver* with that of a **system designer**.  

Outside of building and coding, I enjoy *reading technical books* that broaden my understanding of complex systemsâ€”some of my favorites include **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** (Oâ€™Reilly), **System Design Interview** by Alex Xu, and other resources that help me connect *theoretical knowledge* with **practical design patterns**.
